The `nestcolor` package contains functions for managing visual conventions of NEST graphs. `nestcolor` is used to apply a standardized color palette to NEST `ggplot2` plots and graphical `teal` modules for greater continuity and cohesiveness among NEST package visualizations.

## Installation

For releases from August 2022 it is recommended that you [create and use a Github PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to install the latest version of this package. Once you have the PAT, run the following:

```r
# Installation from CRAN
install.packages('nestcolor')

# For the latest development version you can install from Github
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/nestcolor@*release")
```

## Example

```r
# Implementing the `nestcolor` color palette on a `ggplot2` object
library(ggplot2)
library(nestcolor)

g <- ggplot(msleep, aes(vore)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = conservation))
g
```
